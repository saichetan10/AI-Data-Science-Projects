# SMS Spam Classifier  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model helps in identifying and filtering spam messages effectively.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of text data to remove noise (e.g., punctuation, stopwords).  
- Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF or Bag of Words.  
- Implementation of classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.  
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation  
  - `sklearn` for machine learning and model evaluation  
  - `nltk` or `spacy` for text preprocessing  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
   cd sms-spam-classifier
